This data project aims to visualize the occurence of Female Genital Mutilation in recent years, and create a visual understanding of what the procedure involves.\n",

    "The four major types of FGM, and their subtypes, are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Type I. Partial or total removal of the clitoral glans (the external and visible part of the clitoris, which is a sensitive part of the female genitals, with the function of providing sexual pleasure to the woman), and/or the prepuce/clitoral hood (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoral glans). When it is important to distinguish between the major variations of Type I FGM, the following subdivisions are used:\n",
    "Type Ia. Removal of the prepuce/clitoral hood only.\n",
    "Type Ib. Removal of the clitoral glans with the prepuce/clitoral hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type II.  Partial or total removal of the clitoral glans and the labia minora (the inner folds of the vulva), with or without removal of the labia majora (the outer folds of skin of the vulva). When it is important to distinguish between the major variations of Type II FGM, the following subdivisions are used:\n",
    "Type IIa. Removal of the labia minora only.\n",
    "Type IIb. Partial or total removal of the clitoral glans and the labia minora (prepuce/clitoral hood may be affected).\n",
    "Type IIc. Partial or total removal of the clitoral glans, the labia minora and the labia majora (prepuce/clitoral hood may be affected).\n",
    "\n",
    "Type III. (Often referred to as infibulation). Narrowing of the vaginal opening with the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the labia minora, or labia majora. The covering of the vaginal opening is done with or without removal of the clitoral prepuce/clitoral hood and glans (Type I FGM). When it is important to distinguish between variations of Type III FGM, the following subdivisions are used:\n",
    "Type IIIa. Removal and repositioning of the labia minora.\n",
    "Type IIIb. Removal and repositioning of the labia majora.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type IV. All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, for example pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterization."
