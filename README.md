# Cutting Orchids: A Visual Narrative of Female Genital Mutilation

## Introduction

Just as orchids defy the odds and flourish in the most challenging of environments, individuals impacted by the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) exhibit remarkable resilience and strength. This data story utilizes the symbolism of orchids to shed light on the profound harms of FGM and raise awareness about this pressing issue.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project was sourced from UNICEF, including the following databases:

- FGM-Attitudes-database_May-2023
- FGM-Girls-prevalence-database_May-2023
- FGM-Women-prevalence-database_May-2023-1

## Key Graphics

1. Global Impact of FGM
According to the United Nations Children's Fund, at least 200 million individuals living today have undergone FGM. A study by the University of Birmingham and Exeter estimates that over 44,000 women and girls die each year because of the procedure.

2. Classification of FGM
The World Health Organization categorizes FGM into four types based on the extent of the procedure involved, ranging from clitoridectomy to infibulation and other harmful practices inflicted on female genitals.

3. Prevalence of FGM
Female Genital Mutilation remains prevalent in 31 countries, as indicated by UNICEF data showing the percentage of FGM prevalence in practicing countries.

4. Attitudes Towards FGM
Attitudes around female genital mutilation vary across countries where it is practiced. For instance, in countries with higher prevalence rates such as Somalia, Mali, and Indonesia, less than 20% of participants oppose the harmful practice, while attitudes are shifting in countries like South Africa.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to raise awareness about FGM through the use of subtle imagery and simplified graphics. By making the data more accessible and reader-friendly, the project aims to foster understanding and dialogue surrounding this critical issue.
